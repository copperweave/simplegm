        "You draw up to a pint of water from an object; this dries objects of less than 1 Bulk. \
        The water collects in a globule floating in your hand, which you can direct into a nearby \
        container as part of Casting the Spell; otherwise, it splashes to the ground. You can use \
        this spell in especially humid environments to condense drinkable water from the air, \
        though typically, you can't draw more than a few cups before depleting the \
        ambient moisture."
